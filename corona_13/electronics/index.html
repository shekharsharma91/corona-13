                            <h3>A Circuit Designing Event</h3>
                            <h4>DESCRIPTION:</h4>
                            <p>Are you among those engineers who despise large circuits, ugly integrals and complex machines? Then Circuitrix 
                            is just the event for you! Here is a contest that has more fun than formulas, more concepts than calculations,
                             and more wit than wires. Intellectually stimulating and yet uncomplicated, it requires only a basic conceptual 
                             understanding of electronics. Electrical engineering is not going to be the same again!</p>

                            <p>NO HUMANS…JUST ROBOTS….!!!!
<br/>
Call it football or soccer, either way it’s the world’s most popular sport, and like all the good things in the world robots are out to conquer it…….. !!!
<br/>
Its football time and no-one plays soccer better than engineers, in their own sophisticated way. Its time to show off the machismo, skill and the spirit of soccer with knack of fusing technology with sports seems to be an inherent quality among us. 
 The power of nuts, bolts and the control will be tested here. All you need is an Innovative, Sturdy and Stable design with a Speedy and Accurate mechanism to goal against the opponent on the field.
<br/>
So bring out the zeast in you to win… to feel the spirit of winning….to participate in the ROBO LA LIGA… and to celebrate this very spirit, we hail this event known as <B>ROBO SOCCER.</B>
<br />
It maybe you on the field, but this time it will be your robo that kicks it off. Make your soccer bot kick, turn, run, dodge and set the field on fire with its soccer-some acts. Don’t just make one, let it be the winner!!!
